# Description
In this project, I tackle the challenge of creating a clone of the Netflix Web Application. 
This Netflix clone was possible using the [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/?language=en-US), which provided
a movie posters, descriptions, top movies in varies genres, and more. 

Currently, A user is able to see the different movie names, descriptions, and posters. I am additional working on loading the trailer for each movie for the user to play as well. As of now, the movies are not interactive upon click.
